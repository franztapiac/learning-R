## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Control structures
- control flow of R program

## If-else if-else
```{r}
x=2
if(x>3) {
  y<-10
} else {
  y<-0
}

```

Entire construct is about assigning value to y, so also valid
```{r}
y<-if(x>3) { 
  10
} else {
  0
}
```

## For loops
```{r}
for(i in 1:10){print(i)}
```
```{r}
x<-c("a","b","c","d")
for(i in 1:4){print(x[i])}
```

```{r}
for(i in seq_along(x)){print(x[i])}
```

```{r}
for(letter in x){print(letter)}
```

For single expressions:
```{r}
for(i in 1:4) print(x[i])
```
#### Nested for loops
```{r}
x <-matrix(1:6,2,3)
for(i in seq_len(nrow(x))){  # 1:2
  for(j in seq_len(ncol(x))){  # 1:3
    print(x[i,j])
  }
}
```
## While loops
- Use with care: Could result in infinite loops if not used properly
- With hard limit, use for
```{r}
count <-0
while(count<10){
  print(count)
  count<-count+1
}
```
Testing more than 1 condition at a time
```{r}
z<-5
while(z>=3 && z<=10){ # conditions evaluated from L to R
  print(z)
  coin<-rbinom(1,1,0.5)
  if(coin==1){  # random walk
    z<-z+1
  } else {
    z <-z-1
  }
}
```
## Repeat, next, break
- Break to exit loop entirely, or run forever
- Converging (repeat until 2 values are close)
- No guarantee loop will stop. Better to set hard limit with for loop
- If algo doesn't converge, run for long
```{r}
#x0<-1
#tol<-1e-8
#repeat{
#  x1<-computeEstimate()
#  if(abs(x1-x0)<tol){
#    break
#  } else{
#    x0<-x1
#  }
#}
```

## Next
- to skip iteration(s)
```{r}
for(i in 1:100) {
  if(i<=20) {
    # skip first 20 iterations
    next
  }
  # Do something here
}
```

- Return: exit function and return a given value

## Functions
- Stored as R objects like a vector, d.f
- Class: function
- can have nested functions (fn in fn)

#### Arguments
- have named arguments, included in fn definition
- formal arguments: included in definition
- formals function: takes fn as input and outputs formal arguments
- functions don't use all formal arguments (e.g. missing or default values)

#### Argument matching
- matched positionally or by name
- don't reverse argument order just because can --> confusion
```{r}
mydata<-rnorm(100)
sd(mydata)
sd(x=mydata) # named
sd(x=mydata,na.rm=FALSE)
sd(na.rm=FALSE,x=mydata) # any order when name argument
sd(na.rm=FALSE,mydata) # other passed arguments matched to fn arguments - mydata assigned to data
```
#### Mixing of pos and name matching
- when named matched, 'removed' frmo list and others used for rem arguments in
```{r}
args(lm)
```
- first 5 don't have default: need to specify
- rem: don't need to specify

```{r}
#lm(data=mydata,y~x,model=FALSE,1:100) # y~x to formula, 1:100 to subset
#lm(y~x,mydata,1:100,model=FALSE) # common usage
```

- calling by name: don't need to remember argument order, e.g. plotting fn's

#### Partial matching
- for interactive work
- ttype part of argument name, if unique match, R system will match argument to value in
- Order of operation:
  - 1) exact match for named arg
  - 2) partial match
  - 3) positional match
  
#### Defining function
```{r}
f <- function(a,b=1,c=2,d=NULL) {
  # NULL common value to assign: usually means nothing there
}
```

#### Lazy evaluation
- common model
- arguments to fn only evaluated as needed
```{r}
f<-function(a,b){
  a^2
}
f(2)
```
- Fn doesnt use b, calling f(2) does not give error b/c 2 pos'ly matched to a

```{r}
f<-function(a,b){
  print(a)
  #print(b)
}
f(45)
```
- Error only occured after 45 was printed out.
- If everything before valid, will execute until error part

#### ... Argument
- Variable no of arguments to pass on other functions
- don'y wnat to copy all argument list to new function
```{r}
myplot<-function(x,y,type="1",...){
  #instead of circles, lines -> type=1
  #... absorbs all other arugments into myplot fn
  plot(x,y,type=type,...)
}
```

- Generic functions use ... to pass extra arugmentt to methods
```{r}
mean
function(x,...)
UseMethod("mean")
```

Necessary when no of arguments passed to fn cannot be knowon priori
```{r}
args(paste)

args(cat)
```

#### Arguments after ... argument
- Arguments after must be named explicitly
- cannot have positional or partial matching after 3 dots
- Or R won't know if passing something to ... or diff argument
```{r}
args(paste)
# function(...,sep=" ",collapse=NULL)

paste("a","b",sep=":")
paste("a","b",se=":") # se is another string to paste, but isn't!

```

## Scoping rules
When fn sees symbol in body, how assign value to symbol?
- ther's another function in r called lm, so which function call?
```{r}
lm<-function(x){x*x}
lm # also lm in stats package
```
#### R needs to bind value to symbol
- symbol lm
- needs to bind value to it
- searches through environments to find proper value
- environments: lists of objects/symbols and values
- when need to retrieve value of R object:
  - 1st search global env by name match (lm, first in global env)
  - 2nd search namespaces of each packages on search list
  ( search list: currently loaded onto R)
```{r}
search() #.GlobalEnv always no.1
```
#### Binding values to symbols
- GLobalEnv = user's workspace
- base pkg - last
- Order of packages on search list matters
- can configure which packages get loaded on start up
- can also load packages when want
- cannot assume any packages available or their order
- When load package with library fn, namespace of package gets put in pos 2 of search list
- all else gets pushed one level
- R has sep namespaces for fns and non-fns (e.g. fn c and vector c - possible)

#### Scoping rules for R
- Determine how a value is bound a free vsariable in fn
- IF in a fn, 2 types of variables:
  - fn arguments passed through def
  - other symbols not fn arguments <- how assign value to them (lexical scoping)

#### Lexical scoping
- useful to simplify statisticl cals
```{r}
f<-function(x,y){
  x^2 + y / z # where z come from?
}
```
- z is free variable, what value assign?
- Scoping rules det ^
- The values of free variables are searched for in the env in which function was defined
- Environment: collection of (symbol,value) pairs, i.e. x symbol, 3.13 value
- Every env has parent env. Possible for an env to have multiple 'children'
- Empty env only one without parent
- .Global env: set of (s,v) pairs
- associate fn with env: closure or function closure --> interesting R operations

#### Searching for value for a free variable:
- if in a function, encounter free var, what haps?
- look at env in which function was def'd
- if fn def'd in global, search in global env
- if cannot find in global env, search continues in parent environment of global env
- usual case, parent env is next thing down on search list
- go down list until find value for free var
- possible to def fn outside of global env
- continue search until hit top level env, usually Global env
- if fn defined in a package, top level env is the namesapce of that package
- cannot find ^, continue to last (base), and next: empty environment.
- when hit empty env, error: cannot find value for symbol

#### Lexical Scoping
- Usually free variables found in workspace as fn's defined in Global Env
- In R, can defined functions inside other functions
- A function can return a function
- The returned function was designed in another function
- The environment is the inside of another function, not the global env

#### Constructor functions
- function constructing another
```{r}
make.power<-function(n){
  pow<-function(x){
    x^n  # n free variable. pow will find n vlaue in make.power
  }
  pow
}
cube<-make.power(3)
square<-make.power(2)
cube(3)
square(3)
```
#### Exploring a function closure
- What's in a fn env?
```{r}
ls(environment(cube))
```
```{r}
get("n",environment(cube))
```

##### Lexical vs Dynamics scoping
- Dynamic: other prorgamming languages
```{r}
y<-10
f<-function(x){
  y<-2  # free var
  y^2 + g(x)  # g free var
}
g<-function(x){
  x*y # y free var
}
f(3)
```
- Lexical scoping: y in g found in Global Ev
- Dynamic: y looked up in env from which fn was called (calling env = f)
  - R, calling env= parent frame

#### When They look the same
- When fn defined in global env and called in gloval env, def and call env same
- Gives appearance of dynamic scoping
```{r}
g<-function(x){
  a<-3
  x+a+y
}
y<-3
g(2)
```


#### Other languages support lexical scoping:
- Python
- Perl
- Scheme
- Common lisp: all languages converge to Lisp


#### Consequences of lexical scoping:
- All objects need to be stored in memory, e.g. small objects no problem
- With v large datasets, reading into R challenging if all needs to be stored in memory
- Every function needs to carry pointer to defining enviroment, which could be anywhere
- e.g. function within function

## Scoping rules - Application: optimisation
- Combo of scoping rules and functions, for optimisation
- optimisation routines (optim, nlm, optimise): require that pass a fn to themwhose argument is vector of parameters, e.g. log likelihood (min/max over a range of parameters)
- object function might depend on other things besides parameters, e.g. data
- how specify fn that depends on parameters and data in clearn way?
- when optimising, important to allow user to hold certain parameters fixed

#### Maximising a normal likelihood
- Write constructor fn: neg log likelihood
- R optimisation fns attempt to minimise fns by default
- writing object fns, if defined to be maxed, need to take -ve to minimise
```{r}
make.NegLogLik<-function(data,fixed=c(FALSE,FALSE)) { # fixed det's if want to fix params
  params<-fixed
  function(p){ # parameter vector to optimise over
    params[!fixed]<-p
    mu<-params[1]
    sigma<-params[2]
    a<- -0.5*length(data)*log(2*pi*sigma^2)
    b<- -0.5*sum((data-mu)^2)/(sigma^2)
    -(a+b)
  } # return log likelihood for normal distrib, want to fit data to N
} # returns fn
```

```{r}
set.seed(1); normals<-rnorm(100,1,2)
nLL<-make.NegLogLik(normals)
nLL  # note enclosing environment - pointer to defining enviroment
environment(nLL)  # hexadecimal address
ls(environment(nLL))  # data = free var
```
